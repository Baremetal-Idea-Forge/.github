# Baremetal Idea Forge

Welcome to the **Baremetal Idea Forge** — where code meets caffeine, and debugging is our cardio. We're a merry band of developers who decided that the best way to tackle life's infinite loops was by creating cool stuff together. Whether it’s hobby projects or the occasional contract work, we’re here to push bits, break builds, and maybe learn a thing or two along the way.

## About Us
We’re not just developers; we’re digital blacksmiths forging ideas into code. Our forge runs on a mixture of strong coffee, late-night inspiration, and an unhealthy amount of Stack Overflow tabs. The "baremetal" part of our name reflects our love for starting from the ground up, and our "idea forge" speaks to the collaborative chaos that turns ideas into (mostly working) software.

Here, you'll find a mix of side projects, experiments, and maybe a few "it's-not-a-bug-it's-a-feature" moments. Collaboration is key, and we believe in the age-old principle of "if it compiles, ship it!"

## Our Projects
We dabble in everything from web apps to low-level tinkering. Sometimes we’re crafting beautiful UIs, and sometimes we’re debugging why a pointer decided to go rogue. Whatever the project, you can count on us to over-engineer it for fun and profit. Or at least for fun.

## Meet the Team
Check out the profiles of our talented crew below. We’re the ones writing the code, arguing over tabs vs. spaces (it’s tabs, right?), and making sure the CI pipeline is always... interesting:
<!--
- [Alice](https://github.com/alice) — Frontend magician. She’s so good with CSS, she can make Internet Explorer behave. Almost.
- [Bob](https://github.com/bob) — Backend wizard. If there’s a segfault, he’s probably already patched it.
- [Charlie](https://github.com/charlie) — DevOps extraordinaire. Deploys infrastructure as code faster than you can say “Docker-compose.”
- [Dave](https://github.com/dave) — AI and ML guru. Turns data into magic, one tensor at a time.
-->
(*This list is dynamically updated, because who are we kidding, we’ll probably add someone new after this README is committed.*)

## Want to Join the Forge?
If you’re into coding, memes, and the occasional philosophical debate about whether `null` should exist, we’d love to hear from you. Fork, clone, or just drop us a line. PRs welcome (and so are puns).

## License
Because we’re nice like that, everything here is licensed under [MIT](./LICENSE). Feel free to use, modify, and improve… just don’t blame us if it doesn’t compile on first try.
